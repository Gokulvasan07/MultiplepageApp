    <p><b>
        Abdul Kalam was born into a modest Tamil Muslim family. His father, Jainulabdeen, was a boat owner, and his mother, Ashiamma, was a homemaker. Despite financial constraints, Kalam was a bright student, displaying a keen interest in learning. He completed his schooling at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School in Ramanathapuram and went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, from where he graduated in physics in 1954. Subsequently, he moved to Madras (now Chennai) to study aerospace engineering at the Madras Institute of Technology (MIT).

In 1969, he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III), which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in 1980. This success earned him recognition and marked the beginning of India's advancements in space technology.</b></p>
        
        <p><b></b></p>Kalam returned to DRDO in 1982, and his focus shifted to missile technology. He played a pivotal role in developing the Agni and Prithvi missiles, earning him the nickname “Missile Man of India.” His efforts were crucial in making India a self-reliant nation in missile technology.</b></p>
